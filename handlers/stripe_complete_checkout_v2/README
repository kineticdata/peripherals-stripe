=== Detailed Description
This handler uses the Jira Rest API library to create an issue
within a Jira project. The handler first puts the data that was
inputted into the JSON format and then posts that information
using a REST call with basic auth. (WARNING: Using this handler
without enabling SSL will not be secure). The id, key, and url of
the issue will be returned by the handler. Any errors that occur
during the process will be caught and re-raised by this handler.
